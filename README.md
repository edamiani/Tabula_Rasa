Tabula_Rasa
===========

Game development engine that I&#39;ve created in a hurry back in 2007, using Ogre, OIS, Novodex (PhysX), OpenAL and TinyXML. It was created in less than six months, so do not expect polished code; also, it is not documented. It is being provided AS-IS, in a hope that it might be useful for someone else.
